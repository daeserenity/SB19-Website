<p> <b> SB19 </b> is a five-member Filipino boy band that debuted in 2018, consisting of Josh, Pablo, Stell, Ken, and Justin. They were trained for three years by ShowBT Philippines, beginning in 2016. They are the first Filipino and Southeast Asian act to be nominated in Billboard Music Awards for the Top Social Artist category. They are also the first Southeast Asian act to enter the top 10 of Billboard Social 50 weekly and year-end charts. SB19 promotes its music as part of Pinoy pop (P-pop)—a popular sub-genre of Original Filipino Music.</p>

<h2>Name</h2>
<p>The initials of their Korean management business, ShowBT, were included in the group's moniker. The number 19 was created by multiplying or dividing the country codes of South Korea (82) and the Philippines (80). (63). It represented the two countries' cooperation in the founding of the group. The members, on the other hand, coined the term "Sound Break" to describe their goal of "breaking into the music scene" and improving the standard of Filipino boy bands.</p>

<h2> Here's a time line of SB19's journey </h2>

<ul> 
<li><h3>2016–2018: Formation and early years</h3></li>
<p>
ShowBT Philippines, the Philippine division of ShowBT Group in Korea, founded SB19. After being chosen from hundreds of auditionees during a talent search in 2016, the members went through the same training as K-pop idols. They were simply scheduled to play at business events and activities, but CEO Geong Seong Han decided to make them a boy band. Josh, Pablo, Stell, Ken, and Justin made their debut on October 26, 2018, with the ballad track "Tilaluha." However, their initial promotional efforts, which primarily took place in schools and shopping malls, were met with a "lukewarm" response.
</p>

<li><h3>2019: "Go Up" and rising popularity</h3></li>

<p>
On July 19, 2019, SB19 released their second single, "Go Up." The song was dubbed "their last shot" by Pablo since it was at this point that they agreed to split up if their careers did not grow. They unexpectedly got fame after a fan posted a dance practice video of the song to their YouTube account and shared it on Twitter and Facebook. As opportunities arose, the group began to appear on a variety of radio and television stations, as well as in local and worldwide media. As a follow-up to their viral success, they will conduct their first-ever nationwide concert, SB19: Get in the Zone, on December 22 in ten locations across the Philippines. 
</p>
<p>
SB19 became the first Filipino act to chart on Billboard's Next Big Sound chart on November 20. They were also the first Filipino act to make it into the Billboard Social 50, arriving at number 28 on December 28, 2019. A expanding international popularity, according to Billboard's Jeff Benjamin, assisted their chart presence. "More artists [will] look East for inspiration and a broader audience," he said. The adaptation of ShowBT of the K-pop model is not unique, according to Forbes, but SB19 is the first in the Philippines to thrive owing to their "strategic usage" of social media—the key factor in SB19's placement on the Social 50 chart.
</p>
<p> SB19 signed a recording contract with Sony Music Philippines on December 25, and the group released their third song, "Alab (Burning)," under the new record label on the same day.</p>

<li><h3> 2020: Get in the Zone </h3></li>

<p>
SB19 was added to Spotify's RADAR Program's roster of artists on March 9, 2020, which helps emerging musicians with marketing initiatives. On July 31, 2020, the quintet published their debut album Get in the Zone, which featured nine songs, including three released singles and two unreleased tracks. SB19 reached its best rank on the Social 50 chart, number two behind BTS, two weeks after the album's release on August 15. The ensemble reached number five on the Emerging Artist list a week later, while remaining at number two on the Social 50.</p>

<p> SB19 debuted at number 17 on the LyricFind Global chart the week of October 24th, marking their fourth Billboard chart appearance. After "Alab (Burning)" debuted at number one on LyricFind Global on November 28, the group got their first Billboard number one hit. The next week, "Tilaluha" was also at the top of the same chart. </p>
<p>SB19 debuted at number six on Billboard's Year-End Social 50 chart on December 3, making them the first Southeast Asian act to enter the magazine's top ten. On December 19, "Love Goes" reached number one on LyricFind Global in its third week. Their promotional single "Ikako" debuted at number one the following week, marking the group's fourth top one success on the same chart. </p>

<li><h3> 2021–present: Pagsibol </h3></li>

<p> On January 6, "Hanggang sa Huli" topped the LyricFind Global chart. "Wag Mong Ikunot ang Iyong Noo" debuted at number one on the same chart the week ending January 16. With "Go Up" peaking at number two during the week of January 30, the trio won their eighth number one on the chart. </p>

<p>On February 9, the group revealed their comeback date on social media with a teaser shot. On March 9, 2021, the band released "What?" as the first single from their upcoming extended play, which was originally scheduled to be released in June 2021. On April 24, they debuted their first-ever fashion line, which included two limited premium sets, shirts, and dresses, all inspired by the tune, in conjunction with Chynna Mamawal.</p>

<p>SB19, along with BTS, Blackpink, Ariana Grande, and Seventeen, became the first Filipino and Southeast Asian artist to be nominated for the Billboard Music Awards for Top Social Artist on April 29.
